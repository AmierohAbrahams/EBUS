# 10m u-component of wind	
# m s-1	
# Eastward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air 
# moving towards the east, at a height of ten metres above the surface of 
#the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this
# variable with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time
#scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on 
#average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System. This variable can be combined with the V component of 10m
#wind to give the speed and direction of the horizontal 10m wind.



# 10m v-component of wind	
# m s-1	
# Northward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the north, at a height of ten metres above 
#the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this variable with observations, because wind observations
#vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF 
#Integrated Forecasting System. This variable can be combined with the U component of 10m wind to give the speed and direction of the horizontal 10m wind.
